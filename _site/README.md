# About
This is the repository for the Circuits Club Berlin website. It is written in markdown and built using Jerkyll/Chirpy. Useful links:

[Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)

To run "compile" a Jerkyll website locally, follow [these](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) instructions. Alternatively, use GitHub's workspace.
If everything is setup right, the website should be updated with `bash update.sh`
