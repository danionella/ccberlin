_The Circuits Club Berlin_ is a speaker series envisioned to take place every other month: Invited speakers would present their topic of expertise in systems neuroscience and neighboring fields. In addition to the talk, the speaker will be given the opportunity to visit 2-3 labs during the day and to meet students and postdocs over lunch and at a reception after the talk. The series aims at having vivid discussions with invited speakers, opening doors for future collaborations, and at facilitating scientific exchange among neuroscience labs in Berlin.
